# Prudential_Life_Insurance

Project: Kaggle - Prudential Life Insurance

Objective: This project attempts to automate the risk assessment of life insurance applicants during the underwriting
procedure. The challenge was hidden in the fact that the dataset was semi-anonymous where the attributes were grouped under
six heads namely product info, family info, employment info, general health measurements, medical history info, and different
medical keyword (yes/no). The meaning of the individual attributes under these groups were unknown. Though the underlying
latent risk variable is continuous by nature, we were given an ordinal measurement scale with 1 being the highest riks and 5 being
the lowest. Given approx. 60K data points we were to predict the risk of another 38K applicants on a scale of 1 to 5.
